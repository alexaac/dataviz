Links are usually displayed as simple lines connected between the nodes. However, in some Network Diagrams, not all of the nodes and links are created equally: additional variables can be visualised, for example, by making the node size or link stroke weight proportion to an assigned value. \n The two notable types of Network Diagram are 'undirected' and 'directed'. Undirected Network Diagrams only display the connections between entities, while directed Network Diagrams show if the connections are one-way or two-way through small arrows.  ",

Each category or interval in the data is divided into equal segments on this radial chart. How far each segment extends from the centre of the polar axis depends on the value it represents. So each ring from the centre of the polar grid can be used as a scale to plot the segment size and represent a higher value.

Can become tricky to read with more than 2 series.  \n\n  Also known as a Grouped Bar Chart or Clustered Bar Chart. \n This variation of a Bar Chart is used when two or more data series are plotted side-by-side and grouped together under categories, all on the same axis. \n Like a Bar Chart, the length of each bar is used to show discrete, numerical comparisons amongst categories. Each data series is assigned an individual colour or a varying shade of the same colour, in order to distinguish them. Each group of bars are then spaced apart from each other. \n The use of Multi-set Bar Charts is usually to compare grouped variables or categories to other groups with those same variables or category types. Multi-set Bar Charts can also be used to compare mini Histograms to each other, so each bar in the group would represent the significant intervals of a variable. ',

On each single time period, an OHLC Charts plots a symbol that represents two ranges: the highest and lowest prices traded, and also the opening and closing price on that single time period (for example in a day). On the range symbol, the high and low price ranges are represented by the length of the main vertical line. The open and close prices are represented by the vertical positioning of tick-marks that appear on the left (representing the open price) and on right (representing the close price) sides of the high-low vertical line.

Data that is within each place value is listed and extends sideways from it as a 'leaf'. \n So in a dataset of (4,11,2,20,17,23) the data would be arranged based on their 10's digit but have only their 1's digit displayed: \n 0 - 2, 4 \n 10 - 1, 7 \n 20 - 0, 3 \n As well as giving readers a quick overview of the data distribution, Stem & Leaf Plots are useful for highlighting outliers and finding the mode. Displaying the data (mostly) raw makes Stem & Leaf Plots useful as a reference tool, such as a public transport schedule. If you have two datasets, then a back-to-back or double Stem & Leaf Plot can be used to compare the two datasets together.  ",

Finally, the leaf nodes (or end-nodes) are members who have no children or child nodes. \n Tree Diagrams are often used: \n - To show family relations and descent. \n - In taxonomy, the practice and science of classification. \n - In evolutionary science, to show the origin of species. \n - In computer science and mathematics. \n - In businesses and organisations for managerial purposes.

Also, the area size of the parent category is the total of its subcategories.
